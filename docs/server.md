# Open Topo Data Server Documentation


## Getting started

The easiest way to run Open Topo Data is with Docker. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajnisbet/opentopodata.git
cd opentopodata
make build
make run
```

This will start a server on `localhost:5000` with a small demo dataset called `test-dataset`. Check out the [API docs](api.md) for info about the format of requests and responses.


## Getting started on M1 / Apple Silicon Macs

On M1 Macs you'll probably need to use the alternate `apple-silicon.Dockerfile` docker image, which includes build dependencies for libraries that don't have binaries for M1.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajnisbet/opentopodata.git
cd opentopodata
make build-m1
make run
```

This should work without rosetta. See [issue #55](https://github.com/ajnisbet/opentopodata/issues/55) for more info.


## Getting started on Windows

On Windows you'll probably need to run the build and run commands without make:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajnisbet/opentopodata.git
cd opentopodata
docker build --tag opentopodata --file docker/Dockerfile . 
docker run --rm -it --volume C:/path/to/opentopodata/data:/app/data:ro -p 5000:5000 opentopodata sh -c "/usr/bin/supervisord -c /app/docker/supervisord.conf"
```

For more details see [this note on windows support](notes/windows-support.md).



## Dataset support

Open Topo Data supports all georeferenced raster formats supported by GDAL (e.g, `.tiff`, `.hgt`, `.jp2`).

Datasets can take one of two formats:

* A single raster file.
* A collection of square raster tiles which follow the SRTM naming convention: the file is named for the lower left corner. So a file named `N30W120.tiff` would span from 30 to 31 degrees latitude, and -120 to -119 degrees longitude. By default tiles are 1° by 1° and the coordinates are in WGS84, but this can be configured.


If your dataset consists of multiple files that aren't on a nice grid, you can create a `.vrt` file pointing to the files that Open Topo Data will treat as a single-file dataset. For an example of this process, see the documentation for configuring [EMODnet](datasets/emod2018.md).


## Configuration

Open Topo Data is configured by a `config.yaml` file. If that file is missing it will look for `example-config.yaml` instead. You can set the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to specify a different path.

A config might look like:

```yaml
max_locations_per_request: 100 
access_control_allow_origin: '*'
datasets:
- name: etopo1
  path: data/etopo1/
- name: srtm90m
  path: data/srtm-90m-v3/
  filename_epsg: 4326
  filename_tile_size: 1
```

corresponding to a directory structure:

```
opentopodata
|
└───data
    |
    ├───etopo1
    |   |
    |   └───etopo1-dem.geotiff
    |
    └───srtm-90m-v3
        |
        ├───N00E000.hgt 
        ├───N00E001.hgt 
        ├───N00E002.hgt 
        ├───etc...
```


which would expose `localhost:5000/v1/etopo1` and `localhost:5000/v1/srtm90m`.


### Config spec

* `max_locations_per_request`: Requests with more than this many locations will return a 400 error. Default: `100`.
* `access_control_allow_origin`: Value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` CORS header. Set to `*` or a domain to allow in-browser requests from a different origin. Set to `null` to send no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Default: `null`.
* `datasets[].name`: Dataset name, used in url. Required.
* `datasets[].path`: Path to folder containing the dataset. If the dataset is a single file it must be placed inside a folder. This path is relative to the repository directory inside docker. I suggest placing datasets inside the provided `data` folder, which is mounted in docker by `make run`. Files can be nested arbitrarily inside the dataset path. Required.
* `datasets[].filename_epsg`: For tiled datasets, the projection of the filename coordinates. The default value is `4326`, which is latitude/longitude with the [WGS84 datum](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/).
* `datasets[].filename_tile_size`: For tiled datasets, how large each square tile is in the units of `filename_epsg`. For example, a lat,lon location of `38.2,121.2` would lie in the tile `N38W121` for a tile size of 1, but lie in `N35W120` for a tile size of 5. For non-integer tile sizes like `2.5`, specify them as a string to avoid floating point parsing issues: `"2.5"`. Default: `1`.
* `datasets[].wgs84_bounds.left`: Leftmost (westmost) longitude of the dataset, in WGS84. Used as a performance optimisation for [Multi datasets]('notes/multiple-datasets.md'). Default: `-180`.
* `datasets[].wgs84_bounds.right`: Rightmost (eastmost) longitude of the dataset. Default: `180`.
* `datasets[].wgs84_bounds.bottom`: Bottommost (southmost) latitude of the dataset. Default: `-90`.
* `datasets[].wgs84_bounds.top`: Topmost (northmost) latitude of the dataset. Default: `90`.
* `datasets[].child_datasets[]`: A list of names of other datasets. Querying this MultiDataset will check each dataset in `child_datasets` in order until a non-null elevation is found. For more information see [Multi datasets]('notes/multiple-datasets.md'). 


## Adding datasets

An important goal of Open Topo Data is make is easy to add new datasets. The included dataset is very low resolution ([etopo1](datasets/etopo1.md) downsampled to about 100km) and is intended only for testing.

Adding a new dataset takes two steps:

1. placing the dataset in the `data` directory
2. adding the path to the dataset in `config.yaml`.



Instructions are provided for adding the various datasets used in the public API:


* [ASTER](datasets/aster.md)
* [ETOPO1](datasets/etopo1.md)
* [EU-DEM](datasets/eudem.md)
* [Mapzen](datasets/mapzen.md)
* [NED 10m](datasets/ned.md)
* [NZ DEM](datasets/nzdem.md)
* [SRTM (30m or 90m)](datasets/srtm.md)
* [EMOD Bathymetry](datasets/emod2018.md)
* [GEBCO Bathymetry](datasets/gebco2020.md)
* [BKG Germany (200m)](datasets/bkg.md)
