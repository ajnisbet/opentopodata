# EMODnet 2018 Bathymetry

[EMODnet](https://www.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/) maintains a number of bathymetry (sea floor depth) datasets.

There are currently two datasets with full coverage of Europe: a 1/8 arc minute (~200m) version released in 2016, and a 1/16 arc minute (~100m) version released in 2018. The datasets are a composite of bathymetric surveys, Landsat 8 imagery, and GEBCO data.

The vertical datum used is [Lowest Astronomical Tide](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html).



## Coverage

The 2018 dataset covers a large area around Europe: 15째 to 90째 latitude, and -36째 to 43째 longitude. The elevation over land areas is given as `NODATA` values.

## Adding EMODnet 2018 Bathymetry to Open Topo Data

Make a new folder for the dataset:

```bash
mkdir ./data/emod2018
```

Download the files from [EMODnet](https://portal.emodnet-bathymetry.eu/) into `./data/emod2018`. You want the 2018 dataset, in `ESRI ASCII` format. Extract the zip folders, you should have 59 `.asc` named like `A1_2018.asc`.

Unlike other datasets, the EMOD tiles aren't aligned on a nice whole-number grid, so Open Topo Data can't tell from the filenames which tile covers which area. To handle this we can build a [https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/vrt.html](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/vrt.html) - a single raster file that links to the 59 tiles and which Open Topo Data can treat as a single-file dataset. Unfortunately you'll need to install [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) for this.

Create a new folder for the VRT:
```bash
mkdir ./data/emod2018-vrt
```

Build the vrt using relative paths so the file will work inside the docker image:
```bash
cd ./data/emod2018-vrt
gdalbuildvrt -co VRT_SHARED_SOURCE=0 emod2018.vrt ../emod2018/*.asc
cd ../
```

Create a `config.yaml` file, pointing to the VRT folder:

```yaml
datasets:
- name: emod2018
  path: data/emod2018-vrt/
```

Rebuild to enable the new dataset at [localhost:5000/v1/emod2018](http://localhost:5000/v1/emod2018?locations=37.653512,-119.410503).

```bash
make build && make run
```

!!! tip "Extra performance"

    `.asc` files take up a lot of disk space and are slow for random reads. Consider converting to a compressed geotiff:

    ```
    gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 {asc_filename} {tif_filename}
    ```



## Public API

The Open Topo Data public API lets you query NED 10m for free:

```
curl https://api.opentopodata.org/v1/emod2018?locations=55.884323,2.528276

```

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "elevation": -81.94999694824219, 
      "location": {
        "lat": 55.884323, 
        "lng": 2.528276
      }
    }
  ], 
  "status": "OK"
}
```

The public API uses the 2018 version of the dataset.
